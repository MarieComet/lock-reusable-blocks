Lock Reusable Blocks

== Description ==

Lock Reusable Blocks in the editor to avoid unintentional global changes.
Editing reusable blocks in posts is locked, and you have access to two actions when you select a reusable block in the editor:
- Edit the reusable block (opens the block editing page in a new tab)
- Convert to regular blocks (native action)
